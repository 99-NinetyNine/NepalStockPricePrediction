## Stock Price Prediction using ARIMA, SARIMAX vs LSTM and RNN with Company News Sentiments Analysis

A comprehensive stock price prediction model that utilizes fundamental indicators(EPS, ROI etc.), technical indicators(RSI, MA, MACD etc.), macroeconomic factor(Inflation rate etc.) and news sentiment(VADER analysis) to model and predict the stock prices of companies(NABIL bank in our case). We compared conventional and neural neutwork models i.e. ARIMA and LSTM.
